## PPALACHIA

https://ghostplayermusic.github.io

This is the greatest website of all time. Using the power of image source code, .jpeg files, WAV and mp3 files, a css style sheet, and our ingenuity and creativity, we have created a band page for Ppalachia, our 3-man band representing noise folk music from the Appalachian Trail.

We solved problems including syntax errors, css formatting, and broken links. The css styles sheet was set up as an html file at the top which was causing problems.

At the end of the day, we have a website that is functioning and available on the internet. This has given me some insight into how much work I will need to put in to have a successful final project.

I contributed by editing a lot of the html file on my computer to add photos and gifs. I used inspect element on Reddit, Tenor, and other sites to get images as links from other servers, as well as one image file.

Borys helped get the css style set up on his computer, and both Borys and Tim wrote beautiful bios. Tim also composed a piece of music for the site, which is the third audio file.

Overall we were able to successfully complete the assignment.
