## PALACHIA

https://ghostplayermusic.github.io

This is the greatest website of all time. Using the power of image source code, .jpeg files, WAV and mp3 files, a css style sheet, and our ingenuity and creativity, we have created a band page for Ppalachia, our 3-man band representing noise folk music from the Appalachian Trail.

We solved problems including syntax errors, css formatting, and broken links. The css styles sheet was set up as an html file at the top which was causing problems.

At the end of the day, we have a website that is functioning and available on the internet. This has given me some insight into how much work I will need to put in to have a successful final project.
